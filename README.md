### BI Project using the Superstore Dataset

This is a demo project where I use the software Tableau to create a Business Intelligence dashboard.
The dataset, available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final), contains detailed records of orders from a fictional superstore, including information on shipment modes, customer segments, regional data, product categories, and financial metrics such as sales, costs, and profits.

# Dashboard Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to provide an overview of the superstore's sales performance by analyzing:

- Sales and profits over various product categories
- Reginal demand in the US
- Customer categories
